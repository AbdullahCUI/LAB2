Name(Abdullah) and Login(s):



1. Dennis Ritchie, the creator of the C programming language,
was born on September 9th, 1941.  If he were still alive,
how old would he be today?  Find out by running the `birthday`
program on the appropriate inputs and enter your solution here.

// Year is not correct due to incorrect value
Today is 2023/10/12
Your birthday was 1978/09/09
Hello, Dennis_Ritchie.  You are 45 years, 4 weeks, and 5 days old today


2. Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of the C++ programming
language, the object-oriented extension of C, was born on
December 30th, 1950.  How old is he today?

// Year is not correct due to incorrect value
Today is 2023/10/12
Your birthday was 1980/12/30
Hello, Bjare_Stroustrup.  You are 42 years, 40 weeks, and 5 days old today

3. Software testing often involves testing code with known
"bad" input in an attempt to break it (sometimes this is
referred to as *fuzzing*).  Try breaking the `birthday_cli`
program by giving it "bad" input and observe the consequences.
Give at least two examples of potentially bad input and the
results you observe.

5. Use your working currency conversion to determine
the exchange amounts for the following inputs:

  a) $250.25

   

  b) $1,000.52

    
  c) $968,410.12


6. Suppose that you had used only `int` types
in your conversion program.  Would you be able
to use it to convert the US national debt
(which as of 2020 was \$26,009,754,625,487)?
Why or why not?


7. Mixed types

a) Run the `area` program with 3 and 4 as inputs.  
What value do you get?  Is this result correct?



b) Execute the program again with inputs 3 and 5.
Does the program give correct results?  Why not?



c) Fix the program by editing the `area.c` source
code so that the program produces correct results.
